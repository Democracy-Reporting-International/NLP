# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Welcome to the NLP section of the DRI Digital Democracy GitHub repository! Here you will find scripts about how we on the DD team analyse social media data with natural language processing techniques.
Social media platforms generate an immense amount of textual data that can be analyzed using NLP techniques to extract meaningful insights. The scripts in this repository help you perform various NLP tasks on social media data, including:

-Sentiment analysis text data.

-Topic modeling to uncover hidden themes in the data.

-Using LLMs (such as the ChatGPT API) to summarise text data.


# Best Practice

Our methods here at the DD team are constantly evolving. It is hoped that this repository can serve as a reference for any and all techniques we employ on the team, novel or old. When completing a report that involves a type of analysis not represented here, please upload the script used to the repository here.

Thanks!
